I wrote Datac as an aid for a colleague of mine, Radek Dom√≠n of
<a href="http://rallyanalytics.com">RallyAnalytics</a>, who was looking to
capture automotive performance data using an Apple iOS device such as an iPhone
or iPad (or a suitable Android device). As I had some experience with iPhone
development, I volunteered to help with signal acquisition on the iOS devices.
All of the code for the application was written by me, except where noted
below.

The data capture component was heavily influenced by Apple sample code that
worked with CoreAudio, in particular custom render procedures for AudioUnit
nodes. Time and again, Apple's sample code has proven incredibly useful and
insightful, especially when the documentation is wanting or murky.

The RPM plots rely on
the <a href="http://http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/">Core Plot</a>
framework to do all of the heavy lifting. It is a very nice collection of
classes that render wonderful graphs with all of the eye-candy you want.
Getting it to work properly with Datac's tabbed interface took some doing,
especially when stressed with orientation rotations, but it is nonetheless an
excellent framework that is only getting better.

For application settings, there is nothing better than the 
<a href="http://www.inappsettingskit.com/">InAppSettingsKit (IASK)</a> by Luc
Vandal and Ortwin Gentz. Incredibly versatile collection of classes that track
and extend how Apple's Settings application does it work, while giving the
programmer the ability to do the setting editing all from within the
application, without having to exit and jump over to the Settings app. Even
better, IASK supports different setting definitions depending on where the
editing occurs and on what type of iOS device it is done one.

The integration with <a href="http://dropbox.com/developers">Dropbox</a> was
done in a day using their great SDK package, available to all for free after
registering. I did have to add a way to cancel an active file upload, but
everything else is straight from the SDK. In short, Dropbox is an incredibly
easy way to make available data generated on an iOS device, without having to
waiting for an iTunes connection some time in the future.

I created all of the application icons and images using the
fantastic <a href="http://likethought.com/opacity/">Opacity</a> application. It
is not free, but it is worth every bit of its very-reasonable price. I
especially like the integration with Xcode and the automatic generation of
icons of varying sizes from the same master. It is an incredible times-aver.

If you find this software useful, I'd appreciate
a <a href="mailto:bradhowes@mac.com?subject=About%20Datac">note</a> saying so.
