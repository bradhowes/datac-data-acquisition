      <p>I wrote Datac as an aid for a colleague of mine, Radek Dom√≠n of
	  <a href="http://rallyanalytics.com">RallyAnalytics</a>, who was looking to
	  capture automotive performance data using an Apple iOS device such as an iPhone
	  or iPad (or a suitable Android device). As I had some experience with iPhone
	  development, I volunteered to help with signal acquisition on the iOS devices.
	  All of the code for the application was written by me, except where noted
	  below.
	</p>

	<p>The data capture component was heavily influenced by Apple sample code that
	  worked with CoreAudio, in particular custom render procedures for AudioUnit
	  nodes. Time and again, Apple's sample code has proven incredibly useful and
	  insightful, especially when the documentation is wanting or murky.</p>

	<p>Also note that the Reachability.h and Reachability.mm files were taken from
	  Apple's own Reachability sample application, and provide a very useful
	  notification mechanism for Datac to know when it may attempt to upload a saved
	  recording file. Much, much better than having to work out all of the gory
	  details myself.
	</p>

	<p>The RPM plots rely on
	  the <a href="http://http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/">Core Plot</a>
	  framework to do all of the heavy lifting. It is a very nice collection of
	  classes that render wonderful graphs with all of the eye-candy you want.
	  Getting it to work properly with Datac's tabbed interface took some doing,
	  especially when stressed with orientation rotations, but it is nonetheless an
	  excellent framework that is only getting better.</p>

	<p>For application settings, there is nothing better than the 
	  <a href="http://www.inappsettingskit.com/">InAppSettingsKit (IASK)</a> by Luc
	  Vandal and Ortwin Gentz. Incredibly versatile collection of classes that track
	  and extend how Apple's Settings application does it work, while giving the
	  programmer the ability to do the setting editing all from within the
	  application, without having to exit and jump over to the Settings app. Even
	  better, IASK supports different setting definitions depending on where the
	  editing occurs and on what type of iOS device it is done one.
	</p>

	<p>The integration with <a href="http://dropbox.com/developers">Dropbox</a> was
	  done in a day using their great SDK package, available to all for free after
	  registering. I did have to add a way to cancel an active file upload, but
	  everything else is straight from the SDK. In short, Dropbox is an incredibly
	  easy way to make available data generated on an iOS device, without having to
	  waiting for an iTunes connection some time in the future.
	</p>

	<p>I created all of the application icons and images using the
	  fantastic <a href="http://likethought.com/opacity/">Opacity</a> application. It
	  is not free, but it is worth every bit of its very-reasonable price. I
	  especially like the integration with Xcode and the automatic generation of
	  icons of varying sizes from the same master. It is an incredible times-aver.
	</p>

	<p>If you find this software useful, I'd appreciate
	  a <a href="mailto:bradhowes@mac.com?subject=About%20Datac">note</a> saying so.
	</p>
